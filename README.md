# Dataset-Recommendation-Engine
Dataset Recommendation Engine recommends a dataset from Kaggle that matches your real-world requirement.  

# Current Status
'Kaggle Dataset Recommendation Engine.ipynb' contains the code to generate a similar dataset based on the metadata entered by the end-user. For the POC, we have taken 10 kaggle datasets and manually entered the data.

# Future Direction
'Dataset Recommendation Engine Flask version.ipynb' contains the code to build a Flask application that shows the final version of the product. Currently, this is not linked with the recommendations generated with the 'Kaggle Dataset Recommendation Engine.ipynb' code. Integrating these two files along with scaling up the dataset metadata collection would be the immediate next steps.
